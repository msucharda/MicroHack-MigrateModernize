    > ![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/00945.png)


You have now connected the appliance to your Azure Migrate project. In the next steps we will provide credentials for the appliance to scan your Hyper-V environment

===

### Configure the appliance

Once the appliance finishes registering, you will be able to see it in the Azure Portal, but it still cannot scan your servers because it doesn't have authentication credentials.
We will now provide Hyper-V host credentials. The appliance will use these credentials to scan Hyper-V and discover all servers

1. [ ] In step 2 **Manage credentials and discovery sources**, click **Add credentials**

    username: +++adminuser+++
    
    password: +++demo!pass123+++

    ![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/00946.png)

===

Performing an assessment takes time. To get data we need to run the appliance for hours.

In real-life scenarios, it's better to keep it running for several days. This way Azure Migrate will have a better understanding of application resource requirements and will be able to provide better sizing recommendations.

Since we don't have all this time now, we have prepared another Azure Migrate project with data already populated for you.

===

The report recommends a mix of rehosting and replatforming for your workloads.

Can you spot:
1. [ ] Total cost for all Azure applications?
2. [ ] Cost for applications hosted on VMs?
3. [ ] Cost for SQL databases on VMs?

===
# Azure Cost Assumptions

1. [ ] Expand **Settings** -> **Azure cost**

Here you can fine-tune estimates by adjusting:
- Target regions
- Discount percentages
- Migration timeline  
- Performance buffers

> [!Alert] Changing these settings now will trigger a full recalculation, which takes too long for this exercise.
> For the moment, leave the default values as they are. Once you finish the exercise, you are welcome to come back, adjust the settings, and examine how the results change.

===

# Exercise 3 - .NET App modernization

Before we begin, make sure you are logged into GitHub: [https://github.com/enterprises/skillable-events](https://github.com/enterprises/skillable-events "https://github.com/enterprises/skillable-events")

> [!Knowledge]
> Use the Azure Portal credentials from the resources tab.
> 
> Make sure you don't close the GitHub site. Otherwise GitHub Copilot might not work due to the restrictions of the lab environment.

Let us get our hands dirty on some code.

We want to use GitHub Copilot to modernize our .NET application. To achieve that we have two options.

## 1) Using Visual Studio

You can install an extension that is called *GitHub Copilot app modernization*. This extension uses a dedicated agent inside GitHub Copilot to help you upgrade this project to a newer .NET version and will afterwards support you with the migration to Azure.

With this extension you can:

* Upgrade to a newer version of .NET
* Migrate technologies and deploy to Azure
* Modernize your .NET app, especially when upgrading from .NET Framework
* Assess your application's code, configuration, and dependencies
* Plan and set up the right Azure resource
* Fix issues and apply best practices for cloud migration
* Validate that your app builds and tests successfully

## 2) Using Visual Studio Code

You can use GitHub Copilot agent mode to modernize your .NET application and deploy it to Azure.

Choose your path :)

# 3.2 Code assessment

Before we can start with the modernization itself we need to run an assessment to understand the application's technical foundation, dependencies, and the implemented business logic.

## 1) Visual Studio

The first step is to do a code assessment. For that we will use the *GitHub Copilot app modernization* extension.

TODO: check if it is preinstalled or if we need another step to install it and if we are already logged in to GitHub

1. Right click in the project and select *Modernize*

!IMAGE[0040.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0040.png)

TODO: add descriptions of what happens next

## 2) Visual Studio Code

1. In the navigation bar on the left select *Extensions* and install *GitHub Copilot* and *GitHub Copilot Chat*.
2. Open the GitHub Copilot Chat. A popup will appear asking you to sign in to GitHub. Follow the steps to sign in.
TODO: add credentials! 
3. Select Agent mode and the model of your choice  
   > We recommend Claude Sonnet 4 or 4.5. They generally take longer to respond, but the results are usually good. But feel free to experiment with different models.

4. Use this initial prompt to start the assessment step:

   *I would like to modernize this .NET application to .NET 9. Assess this project and tell me about the technical foundation, dependencies that need to be updated, and give me a brief summary of the implemented business logic and everything else you think is relevant for a modernization. Save the assessment results in an assessment.md in the workspace's root folder. Include all the relevant information in the assesment.md, but stay as short and precise as possible. Ensure there is no redundant information. Do not make any code changes yet.*

5. Wait until GitHub Copilot is done and have a look at the *assessment.md*. Results may vary. If you are for any reason not happy with the results, you have multiple options:

   a) Open a new GitHub Copilot chat (you can click plus on top of the chat window) and run the initial prompt again, but change the file name to *assessment1.md* (or something similar). After the second assessment run is done, ask GitHub Copilot to compare both documents and fact check itself. An example prompt could be:

   *Check the assessment.md and assessment1.md files and compare them. If there are significant differences, check again with the code base and reevaluate the results. Merge all important information into one assessment.md, ensure there is no redundant information, stay precise and delete the other file.*

**OR**

   b) Open a new GitHub Copilot chat (you can click plus on top of the chat window). Delete the *assessment.md* and iterate on the initial prompt yourself so that GitHub Copilot understands better what you want to learn about this problem, then run the assessment again.

If you are happy with the assessment results, continue with the next step of the lab.

===

# 3.3 Upgrade the app to .NET 9

The next step is to upgrade the application to .NET 9 and update the outdated dependencies and packages as they are known to have security vulnerabilities.

## 1) Visual Studio
1. Right click in the project and select *Modernize*
2. Click *Accept upgrade settings and continue*

!IMAGE[0050.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0050.png)

Let s review copilot proposal

TODO: Point to some details

3. Review the proposed plan.
4. Ask what is the most risky part of the upgrade
5. Ask if there are security vulnerabilities in the current solution
6. Ask copilot to perform the upgrade
7. Try to clean and build the solution
8. If there are erros, tell copilot to fix the errors using the chat
9. Run the application again, this time as a standalone DotNet application

!IMAGE[0060.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0060.png)

> [!Hint] If you see an error at runtime. Try asking copilot to fix it for you.
>
> For example, you can paste the error message and let Copilot fix it. For example: `SystemInvalidOperation The ConnectionString has not been initialized.` 

TODO: See the lists of commit, if we managed to fork the repo

## 2) Visual Studio Code

1. Open a fresh new window of GitHub Copilot Chat
2. Use the following prompt to plan the upgrade:

*I would like to upgrade this .NET application to .NET 9. Consider all the information we already collected in the assessment.md. Create a step-by-step plan. Make sure to include updating outdated dependencies and packages that are known to have security vulnerabilities. Do not make any code changes for now, just create the plan. Add the step-by-step plan to the assessment.md. If there is already a migration plan in the assessment.md, edit and extend it.*

3. After the plan is created, use the following prompt to perform the upgrade:

*Now upgrade the application to .NET 9 following the step-by-step plan we created before in the assessment.md. Make sure to update all outdated dependencies and packages that are known to have security vulnerabilities. After you finish, ensure the application builds without errors. If there are any errors, fix them.*

> [!Hint] If you you are an opinionated dev you can give GitHub Copilot more specific instructions e.g. about the folder structure, naming conventions, etc.

4. Observe the changes GitHub Copilot is doing. Inbetween you have to allow certain changes like the editing of sensitive files or the execution of terminal commands. It also may ask you that it has now worked for a while and if it should continue. Allow it to continue. If you observe that it is stuck or working in the wrong direction you can always stop it by clicking the stop button on the lower right and adjust your prompt or start over completely by undoing the changes and opening a new chat.

!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 17.13.37.png](instructions310257/Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 17.13.37.png)

5. After GitHub Copilot has finished the upgrade it will try to build the application (we prompted it to do so). If not, you can prompt it to do it:

*Test and run the application.* or *Build and run the application with **dotnet run**.*

If the build fails, it will try to fix the errors itself. It will have applied a lot of changes. Take your time to review them and click on *Keep* once you are done.

!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 17.37.14.png](instructions310257/Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 17.37.14.png)

> [!Hint] If you have the feeling that GitHub Copilot or VS Code itself is buggy, you can reload the window. This helps in 98% of the cases, for the other 2% just restart VS Code.
> !IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 17.41.41.png](instructions310257/Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 17.41.41.png)

6. If the application is up and running, well done! You have successfully upgraded the application to .NET 9. Click next to continue.

# 3.4 Deploy .NET app to Azure

Next we want to deploy our modernized application to Azure App Service.

## 1) Visual Studio

1. Right click in the project, and select `Modernize`
2. This time, we will select Migrate to Azure. Don't forget to send the message!
> !IMAGE[0070.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0070.png)

3. Copilot made a detailed report for us. Let's take a look at it
       Notice that the report can be exported and shared with other developers in the top right corner
4. Now, let's run the Mandatory Issue: Windows Authenticatio. Click in `Run Task`
> !IMAGE[0080.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0080.png)

## 2) Visual Studio Code

1. Open the Extensions tab again and install the extension *Bicep* (Microsoft's IaC language) and the *Azure MCP Server*
2. Open a fresh new window of GitHub Copilot Chat and click on *Tools*. Checkmark the *Bicep* and *Azure MCP Server* tools and save the changes by clicking on *OK*. This ensures GitHub Copilot has all the tools it needs to deploy to Azure.

!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 18.06.19.png](instructions310257/Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 18.06.19.png)

> [!Hint] The more tools you enable, the longer GitHub Copilot needs to respond. Be mindful of your tool selection.

3. Use the following prompt to deploy the application to Azure:

*I would like to deploy the modernized .NET application to Azure App Service. Please have a look at the existing infra folder and check if it needs to be updated. If so, apply the necessary changes. Then create the infrastructure and deploy the application with the Azure Developer CLI.*

Again you may be asked to allow certain executions of commands and changes. Allow them. When the deployment starts you will output in the terminal window that asks for your input. If GitHub Copilot has not already created an environment, create a new one. Select your Azure subscription, create a new resource group. If the deployment fails, GitHub Copilot will again try to fix the errors itself. 

> [!Hint] If the deployment fails, no worries. The Azure Developer CLI remembers your previous inputs. Just let GitHub Copilot re-try it.

> [!Hint] The actual deployment will start with the execution of the command *azd up*, this may take a while. You may see problems, that there is maybe no quota available in a specific region. Just let GitHub Copilot change the region and re-try it. Just stop it, and bring it back on track if it tries to change from Azure App Service to another PaaS service.

4. When the deployment is successful, you will see the URL of your deployed application in the terminal window. Open it in your browser to verify that everything is working as expected.

!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 18.32.33.png](instructions310257/Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 18.32.33.png)

5. Congratulations! You have successfully modernized and deployed your .NET application with the help of GitHub Copilot. Click next to continue.

### Overview of the Assessment

Assessment results are consumed by GitHub Copilot App Modernization (AppCAT). AppCAT examines the scan findings and produces targeted modernization recommendations to prepare the application for containerization and migration to Azure.

- target: the desired runtime or Azure compute service you plan to move the app to.
- mode: the analysis depth AppCAT should use.

**Analysis targets**

Target values select the rule sets and guidance AppCAT will apply.

| Target | Description |
|--------|---------|
| azure-aks | Guidance and best practices for deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). |
| azure-appservice | Guidance and best practices for deploying to Azure App Service. |
| azure-container-apps | Guidance and best practices for deploying to Azure Container Apps. |
| cloud-readiness | General recommendations to make the app "cloud-ready" for Azure. |
| linux | Recommendations to make the app Linux-ready (packaging, file paths, runtime details). |
| openjdk11 | Compatibility and runtime recommendations for running Java 8 apps on Java 11. |
| openjdk17 | Compatibility and runtime recommendations for running Java 11 apps on Java 17. |
| openjdk21 | Compatibility and runtime recommendations for running Java 17 apps on Java 21. |

**Analysis modes**

Choose how deep AppCAT should inspect the project.

| Mode | Description |
|--------|---------|
| source-only | Fast analysis that examines source code only. |
| full | Full analysis: inspects source code and scans dependencies (slower, more thorough). |

> [!knowledge]  **Where to change these options**
>
> You can customize this report by editing the file at **.github/appmod-java/appcat/assessment-config.yaml** to change targets and modes.
>
>For this lab, AppCAT runs with the following configuration:
>
>```yaml
>appcat:
>  - target:
>      - azure-aks
>      - azure-appservice
>      - azure-container-apps
>    mode: source-only
>```
>
>If you want a broader scan (including dependency checks) change `mode` to `full`, or add/remove entries under `target` to focus recommendations on a specific runtime or Azure compute service.

===

### Review the Assessment results

After the assessment completes, you'll see a success message in the GitHub Copilot chat summarizing what was accomplished:

!IMAGE[assessment report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/02006.png)

The assessment analyzed the Asset Manager application for cloud migration readiness and identified the following:

Key Findings:

* 9 cloud readiness issues requiring attention
* 4 Java upgrade opportunity for modernization

**Resolution Approach:** More than 78% of the identified issues can be automatically resolved through code and configuration updates using GitHub Copilot's built-in app modernization capabilities.

**Issue Prioritization:** Issues are categorized by urgency level to guide remediation efforts:

* Mandatory (Purple) - Critical issues that must be addressed before migration.
* Potential (Blue) - Performance and optimization opportunities.
* Optional (Gray) - Nice-to-have improvements that can be addressed later.

This prioritization framework ensures teams focus on blocking issues first while identifying opportunities for optimization and future enhancements.

### Review Specific Findings

Click on individual issues in the report to see detailed recommendations. In practice, you would review all recommendations and determine the set that aligns with your migration and modernization goals for the application.

> [!note] For this lab, we will spend our time focusing on one modernization recommendation: updating the code to use modern authentication via Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with Entra ID authentication.


| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Modernization Lab Focus** | Database Migration to Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server |
| **What was found** | PostgreSQL database configuration using basic authentication detected in Java source code files |
| **Why this matters** | External dependencies like on-premises databases with legacy authentication must be resolved before migrating to Azure |
| **Recommended solution** | Migrate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server |
| **Benefits** | Fully managed service with automatic backups, scaling, and high availability |

===

### Take Action on Findings

Based on the assessment findings, GitHub Copilot app modernization provides two types of migration actions to assist with modernization opportunities:

1. Using the **guided migrations** ("Run Task" button), which offer fully guided, step-by-step remediation flows for common migration patterns that the tool has been trained to handle. 

2. Using the **unguided migrations** ("Ask Copilot" button), which provide AI assistance with context aware guidance and code suggestions for more complex or custom scenarios.

!IMAGE[module2-step11-guided-migration-vs-copilot-prompts.png](instructions310381/module2-step11-guided-migration-vs-copilot-prompts.png)

For this workshop, we'll focus on one modernization area that demonstrates how to externalize dependencies in the workload to Azure PaaS before deploying to AKS Automatic. We'll migrate from self-hosted PostgreSQL with basic authentication to Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server using Entra ID authentication with AKS Workload Identity.

### Select PostgreSQL Migration Task

Begin the modernization by selecting the desired migration task. For our Spring Boot application, we will migrate to Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server using the Spring option. The other options shown are for generic JDBC usage.

!IMAGE[module2-step12-select-postgres-migration-task.png](instructions310381/module2-step12-select-postgres-migration-task.png)

> [!note]: Choose the "Spring" option for Spring Boot applications, as it provides Spring-specific optimizations and configurations. The generic JDBC options are for non-Spring applications.

### Execute Postgres Migration Task

Click the **Run Task** button described in the previous section to kick off the modernization changes needed in the PetClinic app. This will update the Java code to work with PostgreSQL Flexible Server using Entra ID authentication.

!IMAGE[module2-step12-run-migration-task.png](instructions310381/module2-step12-run-migration-task.png)

The tool will execute the `appmod-run-task` command for `managed-identity-spring/mi-postgresql-spring`, which will examine the workspace structure and initiate the migration task to modernize your Spring Boot application for Azure PostgreSQL with managed identity authentication. If prompted to run shell commands, please review and allow each command as the Agent may require additional context before execution.

### Review Migration Plan and Begin Code Migration

The App Modernization tool has analyzed your Spring Boot application and generated a comprehensive migration plan in its chat window and in the `plan.md` file. This plan outlines the specific changes needed to implement Azure Managed Identity authentication for PostgreSQL connectivity.

!IMAGE[module2-step14-review-migration-plan.png](instructions310381/module2-step14-review-migration-plan.png)

To Begin Migration type **"Continue"** in the GitHub Agent Chat to start the code refactoring.

### Review Migration Process and Progress Tracking

Once you confirm with **"Continue"**, the migration tool begins implementing changes using a structured, two-phase approach designed to ensure traceability and commit changes to a new dedicated code branch for changes to enable rollback if needed.

**Two-Phase Migration Process:**

> [!knowledge] 
> **Phase 1: Update Dependencies**
- **Purpose**: Add the necessary Azure libraries to your project.
- **Changes made**:
  - Updates `pom.xml` with Spring Cloud Azure BOM and PostgreSQL starter dependency
  - Updates `build.gradle` with corresponding Gradle dependencies
  - Adds Spring Cloud Azure version properties.

> [!knowledge] 
> **Phase 2: Configure Application Properties**
- **Purpose**: Update configuration files to use managed identity authentication.
- **Changes made**:
  - Updates `application.properties` to configure PostgreSQL with managed identity (9 lines added, 2 removed)
  - Updates `application-postgres.properties` with Entra ID authentication settings (5 lines added, 4 removed)
  - Replaces username/password authentication with managed identity configuration.

**Progress Tracking:**
The `progress.md` file provides real-time visibility into the migration process:
- **Change documentation**: Detailed
-  log of what changes are being made and why.
- **File modifications**: Clear tracking of which files are being updated.
- **Rationale**: Explanation of the reasoning behind each modification.
- **Status updates**: Real-time progress of the migration work.

> [!hint] 
**How to Monitor Progress:**
- Watch the GitHub Copilot chat for real-time status updates
- Check the `progress.md` file in the migration directory for detailed
-  change logs
- Review the `plan.md` file to understand the complete migration strategy
- Monitor the terminal output for any build or dependency resolution messages
> [!hint] 

### Review Migration Completion Summary

Upon successful completion of the validation process, the App Modernization tool presents a comprehensive migration summary report confirming the successful implementation of Azure Managed Identity authentication for PostgreSQL in your Spring Boot application.

!IMAGE[module2-step17-migration-success-summary.png](instructions310381/module2-step17-migration-success-summary.png)

The migration has successfully transformed your application from **password-based** Postgres authentication to **Azure Managed Identity** for PostgreSQL, removing the need for credentials in code while maintaining application functionality. The process integrated Spring Cloud Azure dependencies, updated configuration properties for managed identity authentication, and ensured all validation stages passed including: **CVE scanning, build validation, consistency checks, and test execution**.

> [!knowledge] Because the workload is based on Java Spring Boot, an advantage of this migration is that no Java code changes were required. Spring Boot's configuration-driven architecture automatically handles database connection details based on the configuration files. 
>
> When switching from password authentication to managed identity, Spring reads the updated configuration and automatically uses the appropriate authentication method. Your existing Java code for database operations (such as saving pet records or retrieving owner information) continues to function as before, but now connects to the database using the more secure managed identity approach.

**Files Modified:**

The migration process updated the following configuration files:

- `pom.xml` and `build.gradle` - Added Spring Cloud Azure dependencies.

- `application.properties` and `application-postgres.properties` - Configured managed identity authentication.

- Test configurations - Updated to work with the new authentication method

> [!hint] Througout this lab, the GitHub Copilot App Modernization extension will create, edit and change various files. The Agent will give you an option to _Keep_ or _Undo_ these changes which will be saved into a new Branch, preserving your original files in case you need to rollback any changes.
!IMAGE[keep-or-undo.png](instructions310381/keep-or-undo.png)


### Validation and Fix Iteration Loop

After implementing the migration changes, the App Modernization tool automatically validates the results through a comprehensive testing process to ensure the migration changes are secure, functional, and consistent.

!IMAGE[module2-step16-cve-validation-iteration-loop.png](instructions310381/module2-step16-cve-validation-iteration-loop.png)

**Validation Stages:**

| Stage | Validation | Details |
|--------|---------|---------
| 1 | **CVE Validation** | Scans newly added dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
| 2 | **Build Validation** | Verifies the application compiles and builds successfully after migration changes.
| 3 | **Consistency Validation** | Ensures all configuration files are properly updated and consistent.
| 4 | **Test Validation** | Executes application tests to verify functionality remains intact.

> [!note] During these stages, you might be prompted to allow the **GitHub Copilot app modernization** extension to access GitHub. Allow it and select your user account when asked.
>
>!IMAGE[allow-ghcp-cve.png](instructions310381/allow-ghcp-cve.png)

**Automated Error Detection and Resolution:**

The tool includes intelligent error detection capabilities that automatically identify and resolve common issues:

- Parses build output to detect compilation errors.
- Identifies root causes of test failures.
- Applies automated fixes for common migration issues.
- Continues through validation iterations (up to 10 iterations) until the build succeeds.

> [!hint] 
> **User Control:**
> At any point during this validation process, you may interrupt the automated fixes and manually resolve issues if you prefer to handle specific problems yourself. The tool provides clear feedback on what it's attempting to fix and allows you to take control when needed at any time.
>
>This systematic approach ensures your Spring Boot application is successfully modernized for Azure PostgreSQL with Entra ID authentication while maintaining full functionality.

##  Generate Containerization Assets with AI

**What You'll Do:** Use AI-powered tools to generate Docker and Kubernetes manifests for your modernized Spring Boot application.

**What You'll Learn:** How to create production-ready containerization assets - including optimized Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests configured with health checks, secrets, and workload identity.

---

### Using Containerization Assist

In the GitHub Copilot agent chat, use the following prompt to generate production-ready Docker and Kubernetes manifests:

```prompt
/petclinic Help me containerize the application. Create me a new Dockerfile and update my ACR with @lab.CloudResourceTemplate(LAB502).Outputs[acrLoginServer]
```

> [!note] To expedite your lab experience, you can allow the Containerization Assist MCP server to run on this Workspace. Select **Allow in this Workspace** or **Always Allow**.
> 
> !IMAGE[ca-mcp-allow.png](instructions310381/ca-mcp-allow.png)
>
> You will also need to allow the MCP server to make LLM requests. 
> Select **Always**.
> !IMAGE[ca-mcp-llm.png](instructions310381/ca-mcp-llm.png)

The Containerization Assist MCP Server will analyze your repository and generate:

- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with optimized base image

- **Kubernetes Deployment**: With Azure workload identity, PostgreSQL secrets, health checks, and resource limits

- **Kubernetes Service**: LoadBalancer configuration for external access

**Expected Result**: Kubernetes manifests in the `k8s/` directory.

> [!tip] You are almost there. You will deploy the AI generated files, but they might need some tuning later. Before deploying it to your cluster, double check the image location, the use of workload identity and if the service connector secret reference in the deployment file are correct to your environment.


### Build and Push Container Image to ACR

Build the containerized application and push it to your Azure Container Registry:

1. In your terminal window, login to ACR using Azure CLI

	```bash
	az acr login --name @lab.CloudResourceTemplate(LAB502).Outputs[acrName]
  
	```

1. Build the Docker image in Azure Container Registry

	```bash
	az acr build -t petclinic:0.0.1 . -r @lab.CloudResourceTemplate(LAB502).Outputs[acrName]
	```

===

## Deploy to AKS

**What You'll Do:** Deploy the modernized application to AKS Automatic using Service Connector secrets for passwordless authentication with PostgreSQL.

**What You'll Learn:** Kubernetes deployment with workload identity, Service Connector integration, and testing deployed applications with Entra ID authentication.

> [!knowledge] **About AKS Automatic:** AKS Automatic is a new mode for Azure Kubernetes Service that provides an optimized and simplified Kubernetes experience. It offers automated cluster management, built-in security best practices, intelligent scaling, and pre-configured monitoring - making it ideal for teams who want to focus on applications rather than infrastructure management.

### Deploy the application to AKS Automatic

Using Containerization Assist we have built a Kubernetes manifest for the Petclini application. In the next steps we will deploy it to the AKS Automatic cluster and verify that it is working:

1. Deploy the application:

	```bash
	kubectl apply -f k8s/petclinic.yaml
	```

1.  Monitor deployment status

	```bash
	kubectl get pods,services,deployments
	```

	It might take a minute for the AKS Automatic cluster to provision new nodes for the workload so it is normal to see your pods in a `Pending` state until the new nodes are available. You can verify is there are nodes available with the `kubectl get nodes` command.

Expect:

```
NAME                                    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
petclinic-deployment-5f9db48c65-qpb8l   0/1     Pending             0          2m2s
```

### Verify Deployment and Connectivity

Test the deployed application and verify Entra ID authentication:

1. Port forward to access the application

	```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/spring-petclinic-service 9090:8080
	```
1. To test the application, open a new tab in Microsoft Edge and go to `http://localhost:9090`


### Validate Entra ID Authentication

Verify that the application is using passwordless authentication:

1. Check environment variables in the pod (get first pod with label)
	```bash
	POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l app=spring-petclinic -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
	kubectl exec $POD_NAME -- env | grep POSTGRES
	```

	Expected output:

	```bash
	AZURE_POSTGRESQL_PORT=5432
	AZURE_POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=petclinic
	AZURE_POSTGRESQL_USERNAME=aad_pg
	AZURE_POSTGRESQL_CLIENTID=1094a914-1837-406a-ad58-b9dcc499177a
	AZURE_POSTGRESQL_HOST=db-petclinic55954159.postgres.database.azure.com
	AZURE_POSTGRESQL_SSL=true
	POSTGRES_USER=aad_pg
	```

1. Verify no password environment variables are present

	```bash
	kubectl exec $POD_NAME -- env | grep -i pass
	```

	Expected output:
  
	```bash
	SPRING_DATASOURCE_AZURE_PASSWORDLESS_ENABLED=true
	```

1. Check application logs for successful authentication

	```bash
	kubectl logs -l app=spring-petclinic --tail=100 | grep -i "hibernate"
	```

	Expected outcome:

	```bash
	[...]
	Hibernate: drop table if exists pets cascade
	Hibernate: drop table if exists specialties cascade
	Hibernate: drop table if exists types cascade
	Hibernate: drop table if exists vet_specialties cascade
	[...]
	```

**Expected Outcome:** The application is successfully deployed to AKS with passwordless authentication to PostgreSQL using Entra ID and workload identity.

### Help

In this section you can find tips on how to troubleshoot your lab.

#### Troubleshooting the local deployment

**If the application fails to start:**
1. Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
2. Verify PostgreSQL container is healthy: `docker logs petclinic-postgres`
3. Check application logs: `tail -f ~/app.log`
4. Ensure port 8080 is not in use: `lsof -i :8080`

**If the database connection fails:**
1. Verify PostgreSQL container is running on port 5432: `docker port petclinic-postgres`
2. Test database connectivity: `docker exec -it petclinic-postgres psql -U petclinic -d petclinic -c "SELECT 1;"`

### Troubleshooting the Service Connector

### Retrieve PostgreSQL Configuration from AKS Service Connector

Before you can use **Containerization Assist**, you must first retrieve the PostgreSQL Service Connector configuration from your AKS cluster.

This information ensures that your generated Kubernetes manifests are correctly wired to the database using managed identity and secret references.

### Access AKS Service Connector and Retrieve PostgreSQL Configuration

1. Open a new tab in the Edge browser and navigate to +++https://portal.azure.com/+++

1. In the top search bar, type **aks-petclinic** and select the AKS Automic cluster.

	!IMAGE[select-aks-petclinic.png](instructions310381/select-aks-petclinic.png)

1. In the left-hand menu under **Settings**, select **Service Connector**.

	!IMAGE[select-sc.jpg](instructions310381/select-sc.jpg)

1.  You'll see the service connection that was automatically created **PostgreSQL connection** with a name that starts with **postgresflexible_** connecting to your PostgreSQL flexible server.

1. Select the **DB for PostgreSQL flexible server** and click the **YAML snippet** button in the action bar

	!IMAGE[yaml-snippet.png](instructions310381/yaml-snippet.png)

1. Expand this connection to see the variables that were created by the `sc-postgresflexiblebft3u-secret` in the cluster

	!IMAGE[sc-variables.png](instructions310381/sc-variables.png)

### Retrieve PostgreSQL YAML Configuration

The Azure Portal will display a YAML snippet showing how to use the Service Connector secrets for PostgreSQL connectivity.
> [+] Service Connector YAML snippet
> 
> !IMAGE[sample-yaml.jpg](instructions310381/sample-yaml.jpg)

> [!note] 
> 1. The portal shows a sample deployment with workload identity configuration
> 2. Key Elements:
>   - Service account: `sc-account-d4157fc8-73b5-4a68-acf4-39c8f22db792`
>   - Secret reference: `sc-postgresflexiblebft3u-secret`
>   - Workload identity label: `azure.workload.identity/use: "true"`
> 
> The Service Connector secret (`sc-postgresflexiblebft3u-secret` in this example), will contain the following variables:
- AZURE_POSTGRESQL_HOST
- AZURE_POSTGRESQL_PORT
- AZURE_POSTGRESQL_DATABASE
- AZURE_POSTGRESQL_CLIENTID (map to both AZURE_CLIENT_ID and AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME)
- AZURE_POSTGRESQL_USERNAME

#### Troubleshooting the application in AKS

If for some reason you've made here and your deployment did not work, your deployment file should ressemble this example.

> [!hint] Key areas to pay close attention to are:
> - `azure.workload.identity/use: "true"`
> - `serviceAccountName: sc-account-XXXX` this needs to reflect the service account created earlier during the PostgreSQL Service Connector
> - `image: <acr-login-server>/petclinic:0.0.1` this should point to your ACR and image created earlier.
