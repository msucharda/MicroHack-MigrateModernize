- **Migrate to Azure Cache for Redis with Managed Identity**
  Replace in-memory or local Redis cache implementations with Azure Cache for Redis for high availability, scalability, and enterprise-grade security.

## How does it work

Once you request the modernization agent to upgrade or migrate your app, Copilot analyzes your projects and their dependencies, and then asks you a series of questions about the upgrade or migration. After you answer these questions, a plan is written in the form of a Markdown file. If you tell Copilot to proceed with the upgrade or migration, it follows the steps described in the plan.

You can adjust the plan by editing the Markdown file to change the upgrade steps or add more context.

### Perform the upgrade or migration

Once a plan is ready, tell Copilot to start using it. Once the process starts, Copilot lets you know what it's doing in the chat window and it opens the **Upgrade Progress Details** document, which lists the status of every step.

If it runs into a problem, Copilot tries to identify the cause of a problem and apply a fix. If Copilot can't seem to correct the problem, it asks for your help. When you intervene, Copilot learns from the changes you make and tries to automatically apply them for you, if the problem is encountered again.

Each major step in the plan is committed to the local Git repository.

### Upgrade and migration results

When the process completes, a report is generated that describes every step taken by Copilot. The tool creates a Git commit for every portion of the process, so you can easily roll back the changes or get detailed information about what changed. The report contains the Git commit hashes.

The report also provides a _Next steps_ section that describes the steps you should take after the upgrade finishes.

GitHub Copilot app modernization is an interactive GitHub Copilot agent that adds powerful capabilities to Visual Studio. This article answers frequently asked questions. For more information about the modernization agent, see [What is GitHub Copilot app modernization](github-copilot-app-modernization-overview.md).

  The tool requires one of the following GitHub Copilot subscriptions:

  - Copilot Pro
  - Copilot Pro+
  - Copilot Business
  - Copilot Enterprise

  GitHub Copilot app modernization is included in [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14.16 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

sections:
  - name: Modernization agent
    questions:
      - question: What can the agent do?
        answer: |
          Currently, GitHub Copilot app modernization helps you upgrade your .NET (.NET, .NET Core, and .NET Framework) projects to newer versions of .NET. It also helps migrate services to Azure. It also upgrades dependencies and fixes errors in the code post-migration. The agent performs the following steps in a GitHub Copilot chat session:

          - Analyzes your projects and proposes an modernization plan.
          - According to the plan, runs a series of tasks to modernize your projects.
          - Operates in a working branch under a local Git repository.
          - Automatically fixes issues during the code transformation.
          - Reports progress and allow access to code changes & logs.
          - Learns from the interactive experience with you (within the context of the session) to improve subsequent transformations.

      - question: What limitations are there?
        answer: |
          - Only Git repositories are supported.
          - There's no guarantee that the upgrade or migration suggestions are considered best practices.
          - The LLM doesn't persist learning from the upgrade. Meaning, code fixes and corrections you provide during the upgrade process don't persist and can't be remembered for future upgrades.
          - It only runs on Windows.

      - question: Which model should I use?
        answer: |
          You should use a good coding model, such as Claude Sonnet 4.0 or Claude Sonnet 3.7.

      - question: Can I train the model based on my code base?
        answer: |
          No. Unlike traditional AI tools where you might enter freeform prompts, the agent operates in a more structured way. The AI is embedded within the build-and-fix process, meaning the prompts it uses are predefined and tied to the upgrade plan. So it's not something you can train on your codebase, and it's not something you can manually steer with custom instructions, beyond the changes you can make to the plan Markdown file.

          However, the agent does have some adaptability within a session. If you manually adjust a fix, it learns from that interaction in the short term and applies similar corrections if it encounters the same issue again. Think of it as refining its approach within the scope of that upgrade.

      - question: Does the agent store my source code?
        answer: |
          The agent never stores a user's codebase and never uses your code for training the model. Once an upgrade or migration is complete, session data is deleted.

      - question: Can I provide feedback?
        answer: |
          Yes! Use the [Suggest a feature](/visualstudio/ide/suggest-a-feature) and [Report a Problem](/visualstudio/ide/report-a-problem) features of in Visual Studio to provide feedback.

      - question: What data is collected?
        answer: |
          The agent only collects telemetry information about project types, intent to upgrade, and upgrade duration. The data is aggregated through Visual Studio itself and doesn't contain any user-identifiable information. For more information about Microsoft's privacy policy, see [Visual Studio Customer Experience Improvement Program](/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-experience-improvement-program?view=vs-2022).

      - question: Can I disable telemetry?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can disable telemetry. In Visual Studio, select **Help** > **Privacy** > **Privacy Settings** > **"No, I would not like to participate."**

  - name: Upgrade .NET apps
    questions:
      - question: What can the agent upgrade?
        answer: |
          GitHub Copilot app modernization helps you upgrade your .NET projects or migrate them to Azure. Besides upgrading the target framework, the agent can work with the following types of projects:

          - Azure Functions.
          - Console apps and class libraries.

          - Desktop technologies such as Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation.
          - Test projects such as MSTest and NUnit.
          - .NET Framework projects.

  - name: Migrate to Azure
    questions:
      - question: What can the agent migrate?
        answer: |
          The agent can assist in migrating and deploying your .NET applications to Azure, including:

          - Web apps
          - API apps
          - Azure Functions
          - Containerized applications

          The migration scenarios include:

          - Modernizing databases
          - Storage
          - Identity
          - Messaging
          - Event streaming
          - Email
          - Logging
          - Security

          For more information about these scenarios, see [Predefined tasks for migration](github-copilot-app-modernization-overview.md#predefined-tasks-for-migration).

      - question: Can I monitor assessment progress?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can monitor the progress of the assessment through the Visual Studio interface. The agent provides real-time feedback and updates on the status of the migration process.

          While the assessment is running, you can monitor its progress by viewing the command-line output:

          1. In Visual Studio, go to **View** > **Output** to open the Output window.

### Predefined tasks for migration

Predefined tasks capture industry best practices for using Azure services. Currently, GitHub Copilot app modernization for .NET offers predefined tasks that cover common migration scenarios.

- **Migrate to Managed Identity based Database on Azure, including Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL MI, and Azure PostgreSQL**

  Modernize your data layer by migrating from on-premises or legacy databases (such as DB2, Oracle DB, or SQL Server) to Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL Managed Instance, or Azure PostgreSQL, using secure managed identity authentication.

- **Migrate to Azure File Storage**

  Move file I/O operations from the local file system to Azure File Storage for scalable, cloud-based file management.

- **Migrate to Azure Blob Storage**

  Replace on-premises or cross-cloud object storage, or local file system file I/O, with Azure Blob Storage for unstructured data.

- **Migrate to Microsoft Entra ID**

  Transition authentication and authorization from Windows Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for modern identity management.

- **Migrate to secured credentials with Managed Identity and Azure Key Vault**

  Replace plaintext credentials in configuration or code with secure, managed identities and Azure Key Vault for secrets management.

- **Migrate to Azure Service Bus**

  Move from legacy or third-party message queues (such as MSMQ or RabbitMQ) or Amazon SQS (AWS Simple Queue Service) to Azure Service Bus for reliable, cloud-based messaging.

- **Migrate to Azure Communication Service email**

  Replace direct SMTP email sending with Azure Communication Service for scalable, secure email delivery.

- **Migrate to Azure Cache for Redis with Managed Identity**
  Replace in-memory or local Redis cache implementations with Azure Cache for Redis for high availability, scalability, and enterprise-grade security.

## How does it work

Once you request the modernization agent to upgrade or migrate your app, Copilot analyzes your projects and their dependencies, and then asks you a series of questions about the upgrade or migration. After you answer these questions, a plan is written in the form of a Markdown file. If you tell Copilot to proceed with the upgrade or migration, it follows the steps described in the plan.

You can adjust the plan by editing the Markdown file to change the upgrade steps or add more context.

### Perform the upgrade or migration

Once a plan is ready, tell Copilot to start using it. Once the process starts, Copilot lets you know what it's doing in the chat window and it opens the **Upgrade Progress Details** document, which lists the status of every step.

If it runs into a problem, Copilot tries to identify the cause of a problem and apply a fix. If Copilot can't seem to correct the problem, it asks for your help. When you intervene, Copilot learns from the changes you make and tries to automatically apply them for you, if the problem is encountered again.

Each major step in the plan is committed to the local Git repository.

### Upgrade and migration results

When the process completes, a report is generated that describes every step taken by Copilot. The tool creates a Git commit for every portion of the process, so you can easily roll back the changes or get detailed information about what changed. The report contains the Git commit hashes.

The report also provides a _Next steps_ section that describes the steps you should take after the upgrade finishes.

GitHub Copilot app modernization is an interactive GitHub Copilot agent that adds powerful capabilities to Visual Studio. This article answers frequently asked questions. For more information about the modernization agent, see [What is GitHub Copilot app modernization](github-copilot-app-modernization-overview.md).

  The tool requires one of the following GitHub Copilot subscriptions:

  - Copilot Pro
  - Copilot Pro+
  - Copilot Business
  - Copilot Enterprise

  GitHub Copilot app modernization is included in [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14.16 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

sections:
  - name: Modernization agent
    questions:
      - question: What can the agent do?
        answer: |
          Currently, GitHub Copilot app modernization helps you upgrade your .NET (.NET, .NET Core, and .NET Framework) projects to newer versions of .NET. It also helps migrate services to Azure. It also upgrades dependencies and fixes errors in the code post-migration. The agent performs the following steps in a GitHub Copilot chat session:

          - Analyzes your projects and proposes an modernization plan.
          - According to the plan, runs a series of tasks to modernize your projects.
          - Operates in a working branch under a local Git repository.
          - Automatically fixes issues during the code transformation.
          - Reports progress and allow access to code changes & logs.
          - Learns from the interactive experience with you (within the context of the session) to improve subsequent transformations.

      - question: What limitations are there?
        answer: |
          - Only Git repositories are supported.
          - There's no guarantee that the upgrade or migration suggestions are considered best practices.
          - The LLM doesn't persist learning from the upgrade. Meaning, code fixes and corrections you provide during the upgrade process don't persist and can't be remembered for future upgrades.
          - It only runs on Windows.

      - question: Which model should I use?
        answer: |
          You should use a good coding model, such as Claude Sonnet 4.0 or Claude Sonnet 3.7.

      - question: Can I train the model based on my code base?
        answer: |
          No. Unlike traditional AI tools where you might enter freeform prompts, the agent operates in a more structured way. The AI is embedded within the build-and-fix process, meaning the prompts it uses are predefined and tied to the upgrade plan. So it's not something you can train on your codebase, and it's not something you can manually steer with custom instructions, beyond the changes you can make to the plan Markdown file.

          However, the agent does have some adaptability within a session. If you manually adjust a fix, it learns from that interaction in the short term and applies similar corrections if it encounters the same issue again. Think of it as refining its approach within the scope of that upgrade.

      - question: Does the agent store my source code?
        answer: |
          The agent never stores a user's codebase and never uses your code for training the model. Once an upgrade or migration is complete, session data is deleted.

      - question: Can I provide feedback?
        answer: |
          Yes! Use the [Suggest a feature](/visualstudio/ide/suggest-a-feature) and [Report a Problem](/visualstudio/ide/report-a-problem) features of in Visual Studio to provide feedback.

      - question: What data is collected?
        answer: |
          The agent only collects telemetry information about project types, intent to upgrade, and upgrade duration. The data is aggregated through Visual Studio itself and doesn't contain any user-identifiable information. For more information about Microsoft's privacy policy, see [Visual Studio Customer Experience Improvement Program](/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-experience-improvement-program?view=vs-2022).

      - question: Can I disable telemetry?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can disable telemetry. In Visual Studio, select **Help** > **Privacy** > **Privacy Settings** > **"No, I would not like to participate."**

  - name: Upgrade .NET apps
    questions:
      - question: What can the agent upgrade?
        answer: |
          GitHub Copilot app modernization helps you upgrade your .NET projects or migrate them to Azure. Besides upgrading the target framework, the agent can work with the following types of projects:

          - Azure Functions.
          - Console apps and class libraries.
          - Web technologies such as:
            - MVC
            - Blazor
            - Razor Pages
            - Web API
          - Desktop technologies such as Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation.
          - Test projects such as MSTest and NUnit.
          - .NET Framework projects.

  - name: Migrate to Azure
    questions:
      - question: What can the agent migrate?
        answer: |
          The agent can assist in migrating and deploying your .NET applications to Azure, including:

          - Web apps
          - API apps
          - Azure Functions
          - Containerized applications

          The migration scenarios include:

          - Modernizing databases
          - Storage
          - Identity
          - Messaging
          - Event streaming
          - Email
          - Logging
          - Security

          For more information about these scenarios, see [Predefined tasks for migration](github-copilot-app-modernization-overview.md#predefined-tasks-for-migration).

      - question: Can I monitor assessment progress?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can monitor the progress of the assessment through the Visual Studio interface. The agent provides real-time feedback and updates on the status of the migration process.

          While the assessment is running, you can monitor its progress by viewing the command-line output:
