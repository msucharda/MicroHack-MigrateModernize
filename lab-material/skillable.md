    > ![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CZSK-MicroHacks/MicroHack-MigrateModernize/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/00945.png)


You have now connected the appliance to your Azure Migrate project. In the next steps we will provide credentials for the appliance to scan your Hyper-V environment

===

### Configure the appliance

Once the appliance finishes registering, you will be able to see it in the Azure Portal, but it still cannot scan your servers because it doesn't have authentication credentials.
We will now provide Hyper-V host credentials. The appliance will use these credentials to scan Hyper-V and discover all servers

1. [ ] In step 2 **Manage credentials and discovery sources**, click **Add credentials**

    username: +++adminuser+++
    
    password: +++demo!pass123+++

    ![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CZSK-MicroHacks/MicroHack-MigrateModernize/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/00946.png)

Performing an assessment takes time. To get data we need to run the appliance for hours.

In real-life scenarios, it's better to keep it running for several days. This way Azure Migrate will have a better understanding of application resource requirements and will be able to provide better sizing recommendations.

Since we don't have all this time now, we have prepared another Azure Migrate project with data already populated for you.

===

# Exercise 1 Summary

**What you accomplished:**

1. ✅ **Environment Setup:** Explored a simulated datacenter environment with nested VMs representing business applications
2. ✅ **Azure Migrate Project:** Created a centralized hub for organizing migration activities and storing discovery data
3. ✅ **Appliance Installation:** Downloaded and deployed the Azure Migrate appliance on your on-premises infrastructure
4. ✅ **Appliance Configuration:** Connected the appliance to Azure and configured credentials for automated discovery
5. ✅ **Data Collection:** Started the continuous discovery process that gathers performance and dependency data

**Key Takeaways:**
- The Azure Migrate appliance is the foundation of any migration assessment
- Proper credential configuration is essential for comprehensive data collection
- Discovery takes time - longer collection periods provide more accurate sizing recommendations
- The appliance runs continuously to capture performance patterns and dependencies

**Next Steps:**
With data collection underway, you're ready to analyze the gathered information and build a migration strategy. In Exercise 2, you'll learn how to turn raw discovery data into actionable migration plans.

===

# Exercise 2: Analyze migration data and build a business case

**Goals:**
- Understand how to review and clean migration data for accuracy
- Learn to group VMs into applications for better migration planning
- Create and analyze a business case to justify migration investments
- Evaluate technical readiness and migration strategies using assessments

## Overview
Your appliance has been collecting data from the on-premises environment. Now it's time to analyze this data and make migration decisions. You'll clean the data, group VMs into applications, build a business case, and perform technical assessments.

1. [ ] Go to the Azure Portal and open the already prepared project: ++lab@lab.LabInstance.Id-azm++

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CZSK-MicroHacks/MicroHack-MigrateModernize/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0095.png)

===
# Prepare your data

Your appliance collects data continuously, but some VMs may have issues that need attention.

1. [ ] Open the Azure Migrate project overview
2. [ ] Open the **Action center** blade from the panel on the left

Common issues you'll see:
- VMs that are powered off
- Connection failures due to wrong credentials  
- Missing performance data

In production, fix these issues for better accuracy. For this lab, we'll work with what we have.

# Create Applications

Group related VMs into applications so they migrate together. This prevents breaking dependencies between components.

Let's create an application for Contoso University:

1. [ ] Expand **Explore applications** in the left panel
2. [ ] Open the **Applications** page
3. [ ] Click **Define application** -> **New application**
4. [ ] In **Name**, enter +++ContosoUniversity+++
5. [ ] In **Type**, select **Custom** (we have source code access)
6. [ ] In **Workloads**, click in **Link Workloads**
7. [ ] In the Filter search bar, type +++ContosoUniversity+++ and select all results and click **Next**

> [+Hint] Screenshot
>
>![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CZSK-MicroHacks/MicroHack-MigrateModernize/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/01002.png)

> [!Knowledge] Important: What is a **workload** in Azure Migrate?
>
> A workload is a distinct application or component that can be discovered, assessed, and migrated independently.
>
>
> For example, if a single VM hosts:
> - the **VM** itself
> - a **SQL database**
> - a **Tomcat web application**
>
> then there are **three workloads** on that VM (the VM, the database, and the web application). Each workload can follow its own migration path and target Azure service.
>
> When you migrate to Azure PaaS, the set of workloads in the **current environment** and the **target environment** may differ. Continuing the same example, you might migrate the SQL database to **Azure SQL Database** and the Tomcat web application to **Azure App Service**, while the original VM is decommissioned. In that target state, you now have **two workloads** (the database and the web application), even though you started with three on the on-premises VM.
    

7. [ ] In **Properties**, select any criticality and complexity, then click in **Review + Create** and then **Create**

You might receive an error message like the one bellow. This is only happening because we are using Preview features from the Azure Portal. Dismiss the error message and continue to the next section

===
# Build a Business Case

A business case shows the financial value of migrating to Azure. It calculates costs, savings, and environmental benefits.

1. [ ] In **Decide and plan**, open **Business cases**
2. [ ] Click **Build business case**

Create a targeted business case for Contoso University:

3. [ ] Name: +++contosouniversity+++
4. [ ] Select **Selected Scope**
5. [ ] Click **Add applications**
6. [ ] Select **ContosoUniversity**, then click **Next**
7. [ ] Choose **West US 2** as target region
8. [ ] Add **15%** Azure discount 
9. [ ] Click **Build business case**

This takes several minutes to calculate. Let's examine a completed example while we wait.

===
# Analyze an Existing Business Case

Let's examine a completed business case that covers the entire datacenter with a modernization focus.

1. [ ] Expand **Decide and Plan** and open **Business cases**
2. [ ] Open **businesscase-for-paas**

## Key Metrics
Notice the overview metrics:
- **Cost comparison:** On-premises vs Azure costs
- **Infrastructure scope:** 40 VMs (13 Linux, 27 Windows), 22 web apps, 6 databases  
- **Annual savings:** $212.3K potential savings

Hover over the info icons to learn how costs are calculated.

1. [ ] Open **Business Case Reports** -> **Current on-premises vs future**
2. [ ] Review the cost breakdown table
3. [ ] Scroll down to see CO₂ emissions reduction estimates

===
# Migration Strategies

1. [ ] Navigate to **Migration Strategies**

This shows Gartner's 6R migration approaches:
- **Rehost:** Lift-and-shift to Azure VMs
- **Replatform:** Move to managed services (Azure SQL MI)
- **Refactor:** Modernize to PaaS (App Service)

The report recommends a mix of rehosting and replatforming for your workloads.
Some applications will be replatformed, some others can only be rehosted. The total cost is the sum of all values

Can you spot:
1. [ ] Total cost for all Azure applications?
2. [ ] Cost for applications hosted on VMs?
3. [ ] Cost for SQL databases on VMs?

===
# Azure Cost Assumptions

1. [ ] Expand **Settings** -> **Azure cost**

Here you can fine-tune estimates by adjusting:
- Target regions
- Discount percentages
- Migration timeline  
- Performance buffers

> [!Alert] Changing these settings now will trigger a full recalculation, which takes too long for this exercise.
> For the moment, leave the default values as they are. Once you finish the exercise, you are welcome to come back, adjust the settings, and examine how the results change.
>

> Learn more in the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/concepts-business-case-calculation?view=migrate)

===
# Technical Assessment

===

# Exercise 3: .NET App modernization

**Goals:**
- Clone and set up the Contoso University .NET application
- Use GitHub Copilot App Modernization to assess the application for cloud readiness
- Upgrade the application from .NET Framework to .NET 9
- Migrate authentication from Windows AD to Microsoft Entra ID
- Resolve cloud readiness issues and deploy to Azure App Service

## Overview
Before we begin, make sure you are logged into GitHub: [https://github.com/enterprises/skillable-events](https://github.com/enterprises/skillable-events "https://github.com/enterprises/skillable-events")

> [!Knowledge]
> Use the Azure Portal credentials from the resources tab.
> 
> Make sure you don't close the GitHub site. Otherwise GitHub Copilot might not work due to the restrictions of the lab environment.

Let us get our hands dirty on some code.

We want to use GitHub Copilot to modernize our .NET application in Visual Studio.

In Visual Studio we have an extension called *GitHub Copilot app modernization*. This extension uses a dedicated agent inside GitHub Copilot to help you upgrade this project to a newer .NET version and will afterwards support you with the migration to Azure.

With this extension you can:

# 3.2 Code assessment + app upgrade to .NET 9

The first step is to do a code assessment, followed by a complete upgrade. For that we will use the *GitHub Copilot app modernization* extension.

1. Right click in the project and select *Modernize*

!IMAGE[0040.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CZSK-MicroHacks/MicroHack-MigrateModernize/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0040.png)

> [!Hint] If GitHub Copilot asks you to sign in, click on *Already have an account? Sign in* and follow the steps to sign in to GitHub.

2. The GitHub Copilot Chat window will open. Click on *Upgrade to a newer .NET version*. It will paste this exact message in the chat window. You can modify the prompt if you want to target a specific .NET version (8, 9 or 10).

**Before you send the message, be sure to select Claude Sonnet 4.5 as the model to use for this task.**

!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-11-16 at 17.34.45.png](instructions310257/Screenshot 2025-11-16 at 17.34.45.png)

3. This task will take a while. In case it asks you to allow operations, allow them by answering in the chat window. If it gets stuck, ask it to continue. If you think it's stuck (it stops working completely), you can a) call your proctors and we help you decide what to do or b) close VS completely and re-open it, but then we need to continue prompting manually.

4. You know when it's done *dotnet-upgrade-report.md* will show up.

===

# 3.3 Deploy the modernized .NET app to Azure

Next we want to deploy our modernized application to Azure App Service.

1. Right click in the project, and select *Modernize* again

!IMAGE[0040.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CZSK-MicroHacks/MicroHack-MigrateModernize/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0040.png)

## Overview of the Assessment

Assessment results are consumed by GitHub Copilot App Modernization (AppCAT). AppCAT examines the scan findings and produces targeted modernization recommendations to prepare the application for containerization and migration to Azure.

- target: the desired runtime or Azure compute service you plan to move the app to.
- mode: the analysis depth AppCAT should use.

**Analysis targets**

Target values select the rule sets and guidance AppCAT will apply.

| Target | Description |
|--------|---------|
| azure-aks | Guidance and best practices for deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). |
| azure-appservice | Guidance and best practices for deploying to Azure App Service. |
| azure-container-apps | Guidance and best practices for deploying to Azure Container Apps. |
| cloud-readiness | General recommendations to make the app "cloud-ready" for Azure. |
| linux | Recommendations to make the app Linux-ready (packaging, file paths, runtime details). |
| openjdk11 | Compatibility and runtime recommendations for running Java 8 apps on Java 11. |
| openjdk17 | Compatibility and runtime recommendations for running Java 11 apps on Java 17. |
| openjdk21 | Compatibility and runtime recommendations for running Java 17 apps on Java 21. |

**Analysis modes**

Choose how deep AppCAT should inspect the project.

| Mode | Description |
|--------|---------|
| source-only | Fast analysis that examines source code only. |
| full | Full analysis: inspects source code and scans dependencies (slower, more thorough). |

> [!knowledge]  **Where to change these options**
>
> You can customize this report by editing the file at **.github/appmod-java/appcat/assessment-config.yaml** to change targets and modes.
>
>For this lab, AppCAT runs with the following configuration:
>
>```yaml
>appcat:
>  - target:
>      - azure-aks
>      - azure-appservice
>      - azure-container-apps
>    mode: source-only
>```
>
>If you want a broader scan (including dependency checks) change `mode` to `full`, or add/remove entries under `target` to focus recommendations on a specific runtime or Azure compute service.

===

## Review the Assessment results

After the assessment completes, you'll see a success message in the GitHub Copilot chat summarizing what was accomplished:

![assessment report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CZSK-MicroHacks/MicroHack-MigrateModernize/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/02006.png)

The assessment analyzed the Asset Manager application for cloud migration readiness and identified the following:

Key Findings:

* 9 cloud readiness issues requiring attention
* 4 Java upgrade opportunity for modernization

**Resolution Approach:** More than 78% of the identified issues can be automatically resolved through code and configuration updates using GitHub Copilot's built-in app modernization capabilities.

**Issue Prioritization:** Issues are categorized by urgency level to guide remediation efforts:

* Mandatory (Purple) - Critical issues that must be addressed before migration.
* Potential (Blue) - Performance and optimization opportunities.
* Optional (Gray) - Nice-to-have improvements that can be addressed later.

This prioritization framework ensures teams focus on blocking issues first while identifying opportunities for optimization and future enhancements.

## Review Specific Findings

Click on individual issues in the report to see detailed recommendations. In practice, you would review all recommendations and determine the set that aligns with your migration and modernization goals for the application.

> [!note] For this lab, we will spend our time focusing on one modernization recommendation: updating the code to use Azure Blob Storage instead of AWS S3 buckets.


| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Modernization Lab Focus** | Storage Migration (AWS S3) |
| **What was found** | Migrate from AWS S3 to Azure Blob Storage for scalable and secure storage in Azure |
| **Why this matters** | Migrating an application requires dependencies like storage to migrated alongside the code and data.  |
| **Recommended solution** | Migrate from AWS S3 to Azure Blob Storage |
| **Benefits** | Migrating from S3 to Azure Blob Storage enables seamless integration with other Azure services (like Azure Functions, App Service, and Azure AI), unified identity management through Azure Active Directory, and potential cost savings through features like automated tiering and lifecycle management policies. |

===

## Take Action on Findings

Based on the assessment findings, GitHub Copilot app modernization provides two types of migration actions to assist with modernization opportunities:

1. Using the **guided migrations** ("Run Task" button), which offer fully guided, step-by-step remediation flows for common migration patterns that the tool has been trained to handle. 

2. Using the **unguided migrations** ("Ask Copilot" button), which provide AI assistance with context aware guidance and code suggestions for more complex or custom scenarios.

!IMAGE[4somda23.jpg](instructions310257/4somda23.jpg)

For this workshop, we'll focus on one modernization area that demonstrates how to externalize dependencies in the workload to Azure PaaS before deploying to app service. We'll migrate from AWS S3 buckets to Azure Blob Storage.

===

### Select AWS S3 Task

Begin the modernization by selecting the desired migration task. For our java application, we will migrate to Azure Blob Storage.  You can expand the migration task to see detail about what will happen during the task and an explanation of why it's important to our modernization.

!IMAGE[uoobnjjf.jpg](instructions310257/uoobnjjf.jpg)

### Execute AWS S3 Migration Task

Click the **Run Task** button described in the previous section to kick off the modernization changes needed in the Asset Manager app. This will update the Java code to work Azure Blob Storage instead of AWS S3.

The tool will execute the `appmod-run-task` command for `s3-to-azure-blob-storage` for the Java project, which will examine the workspace structure and initiate the migration task to modernize your java for Azure Blob Storage. If prompted to run shell commands, please review and allow each command as the Agent may require additional context before execution.

### Review Migration Plan and Begin Code Migration

The App Modernization tool has analyzed your java application and generated a comprehensive migration plan in its chat window and in the `plan.md` file. This plan outlines the specific changes needed to implement Azure Blob Storage instead of AWS S3.

!IMAGE[wpoydt5u.jpg](instructions310257/wpoydt5u.jpg)

To Begin Migration type **"Continue"** in the GitHub Agent Chat to start the code refactoring.

===

## Review Migration Process and Progress Tracking

Once you confirm with **"Continue"**, the migration tool begins implementing changes using a structured, two-phase approach designed to ensure traceability and commit changes to a new dedicated code branch for changes to enable rollback if needed.
<!--
**Two-Phase Migration Process:**

> [!knowledge] 
> **Phase 1: Update Dependencies**
- **Purpose**: Add the necessary Azure libraries to your project.
- **Changes made**:
  - Updates `pom.xml` with Azure SDK BOM 
  - Updates `build.gradle` with corresponding Gradle dependencies
  - Adds Spring Cloud Azure version properties.

> [!knowledge] 
> **Phase 2: Configure Application Properties**
- **Purpose**: Update configuration files to use managed identity authentication.
- **Changes made**:
  - Updates `application.properties` to configure PostgreSQL with managed identity (9 lines added, 2 removed)
  - Updates `application-postgres.properties` with Entra ID authentication settings (5 lines added, 4 removed)
  - Replaces username/password authentication with managed identity configuration. -->

**Progress Tracking:**
The `progress.md` file provides real-time visibility into the migration process:
- **Change documentation**: Detailed
-  log of what changes are being made and why.
- **File modifications**: Clear tracking of which files are being updated.
- **Rationale**: Explanation of the reasoning behind each modification.
- **Status updates**: Real-time progress of the migration work.

> [!hint] 
**How to Monitor Progress:**
- Watch the GitHub Copilot chat for real-time status updates
- Check the `progress.md` file in the migration directory for detailed
-  change logs
- Review the `plan.md` file to understand the complete migration strategy
- Monitor the terminal output for any build or dependency resolution messages
> [!hint] 

### Review Migration Completion Summary

Upon successful completion of the validation process, the App Modernization tool presents a comprehensive migration summary report confirming the successful implementation of Azure Blob Storage in your java application.

!IMAGE[ovfbrre3.jpg](instructions310257/ovfbrre3.jpg)

The migration has successfully transformed your application from supporting Amazon S3 storage to instead supporting Azure Blob Storage while maintaining application functionality. The process integrated java Azure dependencies, updated configuration properties, and ensured all validation stages passed including: **CVE scanning, build validation, consistency checks, and test execution**.

**Files Modified:**

The migration process updated the following configuration files:

- `pom.xml` and `build.gradle` - Added Spring Cloud Azure dependencies.

- `application.properties` and `application-postgres.properties` - Configured managed identity authentication.

- Test configurations - Updated to work with the new authentication method

> [!hint] Througout this lab, the GitHub Copilot App Modernization extension will create, edit and change various files. The Agent will give you an option to _Keep_ or _Undo_ these changes which will be saved into a new Branch, preserving your original files in case you need to rollback any changes.
!IMAGE[8fp2nrzs.jpg](instructions310257/8fp2nrzs.jpg)

===

## Validation and Fix Iteration Loop

After implementing the migration changes, the App Modernization tool automatically validates the results through a comprehensive testing process to ensure the migration changes are secure, functional, and consistent.

!IMAGE[y18ydpod.jpg](instructions310257/y18ydpod.jpg)

**Validation Stages:**

| Stage | Validation | Details |
|--------|---------|---------
| 1 | **CVE Validation** | Scans newly added dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
| 2 | **Build Validation** | Verifies the application compiles and builds successfully after migration changes.
| 3 | **Consistency Validation** | Ensures all configuration files are properly updated and consistent.
| 4 | **Test Validation** | Executes application tests to verify functionality remains intact.

> [!note] During these stages, you might be prompted to allow the **GitHub Copilot app modernization** extension to access GitHub. Allow it and select your user account when asked.
>
>!IMAGE[vflz96jl.jpg](instructions310257/vflz96jl.jpg)

**Automated Error Detection and Resolution:**

The tool includes intelligent error detection capabilities that automatically identify and resolve common issues:

- Parses build output to detect compilation errors.
- Identifies root causes of test failures.
- Applies automated fixes for common migration issues.
- Continues through validation iterations (up to 10 iterations) until the build succeeds.

> [!hint] 
> **User Control:**
> At any point during this validation process, you may interrupt the automated fixes and manually resolve issues if you prefer to handle specific problems yourself. The tool provides clear feedback on what it's attempting to fix and allows you to take control when needed at any time.
>
>This systematic approach ensures your java application is successfully modernized for Azure Blob Storage while maintaining full functionality.
