### Understand our lab environment

The lab simulates a datacenter, by having a VM hosting server, and several VMs inside simulating different applications

1. [ ] Open Edge, and head to the Azure Portal using the following link. This link enables some of the preview features we will need later on: ++https://aka.ms/migrate/disconnectedAppliance++
1. [ ] Login using the credentials in the Resources tab. Notice that instead of using the Password, you are probably going to be requested to use the Temporary Access Password (TAP)

> [+Hint] Troubles finding the resource tab?
>
> Navigate to the top right corner of this screen, in there you can always find the credentials and important information
> ![text to display](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0010.png)

1. [ ] Open the list of resource groups. You will find on called `on-prem`
2. [ ] Explore the resource group. Find a VM called `lab@lab.LabInstance.Id-vm`
3. [ ] Open the VM. Click in `Connect`. Wait until the page is fullo loaded
4. [ ] Click in `Download RDP file` wait until the download is complete and open it
5. [ ] Login to the VM using the credentials
    1. [ ] Username: `adminuser`
    2. [ ] Password: `demo!pass123`


You have now loged in into your on-premises server!
Let's explore whats inside in the next chapter

===
### Understand our lab environment: The VM

This Virtual machine represents an on-premises server.
It has nested virtualization. Inside you will find several VMs.

> ![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0020.png)

In the windows menu, open the `Hyper-V Manager` to discover the inner VMs.

TODO: Open one of the vms and see the application running

We will now create another VM, and install the Azure Migrate Appliance

1. [ ] Click Finish, and start the new VM by doing right click **Start** 
1. [ ] Double click in the VM to open a Remote Desktop to it. Initially, it will have a back scree for several minutes until it starts

You have now an appliance up and running in your server. This appliance will scan all the VMs and collect all neded information to be able to plan a migration. Now, we need to configure the appliance in order it is able to run a scan on the environment


===

### Connect to the appliance

We will now configure the appliance.

1. [ ] Start by accepting the License terms
1. [ ] Assign a password for the appliance. Use +++Demo!pass123+++
1. [ ] Send a **Ctrl+Alt+Del** command and log in into the VM

  	> ![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0093.png)

===

### Connect the appliance to Azure Migrate

Once we login, the machine will configure itself. Wait until the browser displays the Azure Migrate Appliance Configuration. This will take about 4 minutes

1. [ ] Agree to the Term of use and wait until it checks the connectivity to Azure
	> [+Hint] Screenshot
  	>
  	> ![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/00932.png)

1. [ ] Paste the Key we got while creating the Appliance into the Azure Portal, and click **Verify**. 

   During this process, the appliance software is updated. This will take several minutes and will require to refresh the page.

    > [+Hint] Your key was: 
    > ++@lab.Variable(MigrateApplianceKey)++


	> [+Hint] If Copy & Paste does not work
  	>
  	> You can type the clipboard in the VM
    > ![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0094.png)

1. [ ] Login to Azure. If the **Login** button is grayed out, you need to **Verify** the key from the previous step again

    > [+Hint] Hint
    >
	> Remember that the credentials are in the **Resources** tab.
    > ![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/00945.png)


You have now connected the Appliance to your Azure Migrate project. In the next steps we will provide credentials for the appliance to be able to scan your Hyper-V environment

===

### Configure the appliance

Once the appliance finishes Registering, you will be able to see it in the Azure Portal, but still it cannot scan your servers because it does not have a way to authenticate.
We will now provide Hyper-V host credentials. The appliance will use these credentials to scan Hyper-V and discover all servers

1. [ ] In step 2 **Manage credentials and discovery sources**, click in **Add credentials**

    username: +++adminuser+++
    
    password: +++demo!pass123+++

# Clone the application repo

We have found our first target application to be migrated: `Contoso University`

TODO: It would be better to fork the repo, and be able to commit

1. [] Since we are going to modernize it first, lets get in the shoes of the developers that will execute the migration

  1. [ ] Open Visual Studio
  2. [ ] Select Clone a repository
  3. [ ] In the `Repository Location`, paste this repo ++https://github.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab.git++
  4. [ ] Click Clone

1.[] Let's open the solution now. In Visual Studio
  1. [ ] File -> Open
  2. [ ] Navigate to `migrate-modernize-lab`, `src`, `Contoso University`
  3. [ ] Find the file `ContosoUniversity.sln`
  4. [ ] In the `View` menu, click `Solution Explorer`
  5. [ ] Rebuild the solution

      > [!Hint] TODO: Troubles building? Make sure you have Nuget.org package sources


It is not required for the lab, but if you want, you can run the solution in IIS Express (Microsoft Edge)
 
!IMAGE[0030.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0030.png)

Edge will open, and you will see the application running in `https://localhost:44300`


===

# Running a code assessment

We will modernize this application.
The first step is to do a code assessment. For that we will use GitHub Copilot for App Modernization

1. [ ] Right click in the project, and select `Modernize`

!IMAGE[0040.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0040.png)
===


# Upgrade to a newer version

We will do the migration in two steps. First we will upgrade the application to the latest DotNet, since many packages are outdated with known security vulnerabilities,

1. [ ] Right click in the project, and select `Modernize`
2. [ ] Click in `Accept upgrade settings and continue`. Make sure you send the message

!IMAGE[0050.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0050.png)

Let s review copilot proposal

TODO: Point to some details

3. [ ] Review the proposed plan.
4. [ ] Ask what is the most risky part of the upgrade
5. [ ] Ask if there are security vulnerabilities in the current solution
6. [ ] Ask copilot to perform the upgrade
7. [ ] Try to clean and build the solution
8. [ ] If there are erros, tell copilot to fix the errors using the chat
9. [ ] Run the application again, this time as a standalone DotNet application

!IMAGE[0060.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crgarcia12/migrate-modernize-lab/refs/heads/main/lab-material/media/0060.png)

> [!Hint] If you see an error at runtime. Try asking copilot to fix it for you.
>
> For example, you can paste the error message and let Copilot fix it. For example: `SystemInvalidOperation The ConnectionString has not been initialized.` 

TODO: See the lists of commit, if we managed to fork the repo
