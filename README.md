# Azure Migration & Modernization MicroHack

This MicroHack scenario walks through a complete migration and modernization journey using Azure Migrate and GitHub Copilot. The experience covers discovery, assessment, business case development, and application modernization for both .NET and Java workloads.

## MicroHack Context

This MicroHack provides hands-on experience with the entire migration lifecycle - from initial discovery of on-premises infrastructure through to deploying modernized applications on Azure. You'll work with a simulated datacenter environment and use AI-powered tools to accelerate modernization.

**Key Technologies:**
- Azure Migrate for discovery and assessment
- GitHub Copilot for AI-powered code modernization
- Azure Container Apps for hosting modernized applications

## Environment creation

Install Azure PowerShell and authenticated to your Azure subscription:
```PowerShell
Install-Module Az
Connect-AzAccount
```

Please note:

- GitHub account with GitHub Copilot access

**Required Software:**
- Visual Studio 2022 (for .NET modernization)
- Visual Studio Code (for Java modernization)
- Docker Desktop
- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 and JDK 21)
- Maven

**Alternative: Use GitHub Codespaces** (recommended if you don't have required software installed locally)

If you don't have the required software installed locally, you can use **GitHub Codespaces** for application modernization. Codespaces provides a cloud-based development environment with VS Code and common development tools pre-configured.

**Benefits of Using Codespaces:**
- No local software installation required
- Pre-configured development environment
- Access from any device with a web browser
- Consistent development environment across team members

**How to Use Codespaces for Modernization:**

1. **Fork the Repository**: Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button to create your own copy.

2. **Create a Codespace**:
   - In your forked repository, click the green **Code** button
   - Select the **Codespaces** tab
   - Click **Create codespace on main**
   - Wait for the environment to initialize (this may take a few minutes)

3. **Install GitHub Copilot App Modernization Extension**:
   
   Once your Codespace is running, install the GitHub Copilot App Modernization extension:
   
   - Open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS)
   - Search for "GitHub Copilot App Modernization"
   - Click **Install**
   - Restart the Codespace if prompted
   - Sign in to GitHub Copilot when prompted

   > **Note**: You need a GitHub Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise subscription to use this extension.

4. **Use GitHub Copilot for Autonomous Modernization**:
   
   The GitHub Copilot App Modernization extension can autonomously find and modernize applications. Here's how:
   
   **For .NET Applications (like ContosoUniversity):**
   - Navigate to the ContosoUniversity project in the Explorer
   - Open the GitHub Copilot App Modernization extension from the Activity Bar
   - Use the following example prompt in the Copilot Chat:
     ```
     Find the ASP.NET application in this repository and modernize it to .NET 10.
     Upgrade the framework, migrate authentication from Windows AD to Microsoft Entra ID,
     and prepare it for Azure Container Apps deployment.
     ```
   - The agent will analyze the application, create a migration plan, and execute the modernization autonomously
   
   **For Java Applications (like AssetManager):**
   - Navigate to the AssetManager project in the Explorer
   - Open the GitHub Copilot App Modernization extension from the Activity Bar
   - Click **Migrate to Azure** to trigger the assessment
   - Use example prompts like:
     ```
     Assess this Java application and identify all modernization opportunities.
     Migrate from AWS S3 to Azure Blob Storage, upgrade from Java 8 to Java 21,
     and migrate from Spring Boot 2.x to 3.x autonomously.
     ```
   - The agent will perform the assessment and execute the guided migration tasks
   
   **Alternative Prompt for Complete Modernization:**
   ```
   Find all applications in this repository (both .NET and Java) and create a
   comprehensive modernization plan. Execute the modernization autonomously,
   including framework upgrades, cloud migration, and Azure service integration.
   ```

5. **Monitor the Modernization Process**:
   - **Watch the Copilot Chat** for real-time status updates and progress
   - **Review Generated Files**: Check `plan.md`, `progress.md`, or `dotnet-upgrade-report.md` for detailed logs
   - **Allow Operations**: Click "Allow" when prompted for operations during the migration
   - **Review Code Changes**: The extension will show you the proposed changes in the editor
   - **Track Validation**: Monitor automated validation steps (CVE scanning, build validation, tests)

6. **Review and Apply Changes**:
   - **Review the Migration Plan**: Before execution starts, carefully review the generated migration plan
   - **Examine Code Diffs**: Use the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G) to see all changes
   - **Test Incrementally**: After each major migration step completes, review and test the changes
   - **Click "Keep"**: When satisfied with the changes, click "Keep" to apply them
   - **Resolve Issues**: If validation fails, the agent will attempt to fix issues automatically
   - **Commit Changes**: Once all changes are validated, commit them to your branch

7. **Deploy to Azure**:
   - After modernization completes successfully, the agent can help you deploy to Azure
   - Follow the deployment prompts in the Copilot Chat
   - The agent will provision necessary Azure resources and deploy your application

**Important Notes:**
- The modernization process is **autonomous** but requires your **supervision and approval**
- Always **monitor the chat** for questions or confirmations from the agent
- **Review all code changes** before accepting them to ensure they meet your requirements
- The agent will create a **new branch** for changes, allowing you to review before merging
- **Validate the application** runs correctly after each major migration step
- Keep an eye on the **validation results** (CVE scans, build status, test results)

**Azure Resources:**
The lab environment provides:
- Resource Group: `on-prem`
- Hyper-V host VM with nested virtualization
- Pre-configured virtual machines simulating datacenter workloads
